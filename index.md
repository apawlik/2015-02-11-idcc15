title: Data Carpentry: Using APIs to access life science data available on the web
---


[Full day workshop](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/workshops#workshop2) at the 
[10th International Digital Curation Conference](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15)

Wednesday, 11th February, 2015


Speakers: Aleksandra Pawlik, University of Manchester & Data Carpenry  


**Objectives of the workshop:**  

The objectives:

 * directly experiencing Data Carpentry teaching style;  
 * discussing the applicability of Data Carpentry lessons to the participants' own working context;  
 * demonstrating the power of prgrammatically accessing data from the web;  
 * hands-on learning  using API with ROpenSci packages to access data from the web;  
 * hands-on experience on collaborative lesson development and improvement (via GitHub) 

This workshop aims to allow the participants learn more about Data Carpentry from different perspectives:    
1. That of a **workshop attendee** - by learning a bit about manipulating data in R.  
2. That of a potential **host and instructor** - by discussing how and whether the Data Carpentry model of teaching and curriculum is useful for different researchers in different disciplines.  
3. That of **training materials contributor** - by suggesting and making changes to the material used at the beginning of the workshop.





**Introduction**  

*It has been established that the growing availability of well-curated and publicly-available datasets can advance research progress in many domains. However, many researchers still lack the data analysis and management skills to most effectively use these datasets. Data must be accessed from remote repositories and large scale analyses conducted with command line tools or programming languages such as Python or R. Data Carpentry workshops aim to teach these concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data to researchers, particularly those with little prior computational experience. In this workshop, we will conduct an introductory hands-on lesson for using R and ROpenSci packages to access data from the web through APIs. We will follow this with a discussion of the lesson and the effectiveness of the materials and approach and finally conduct collaborative lesson development/improvement through github. This workshop is for anyone interested in learning more about using APIs and R for accessing and working with data or if they are interested in learning more about Data Carpentry workshops to see if they would be useful for researchers they work with in their communities.*


###Agenda:


**09:00 - 09:30** Introduction and aims of the workshop  
**09:30 - 10:00** Setup help  
**10:00 - 11:00** Initial work with R  
[Overwiev and introduction to RStudio](https://github.com/apawlik/datacarpentry/blob/master/lessons/R/00-before-we-start.Rmd)  
[Starting with  R](https://github.com/apawlik/datacarpentry/blob/master/lessons/R/01-intro-to-R.Rmd)    (a)  
**11:00 - 11:20** Break  
**11:20 - 12:00** [Using ROpenSci packages to access data from the web through API](https://github.com/apawlik/2015-02-11-idcc15/blob/gh-pages/ropensci-package.md)  
**12:00 - 12:30** Breakout discussion -  using [the wiki](https://github.com/apawlik/2015-02-11-idcc15/wiki) (b)  
**12:30 - 13:30** Lunch  
**13:30 - 14:00** Reporting back and discussion (c)   
**14:00 - 15:00** Collaborative lesson development and improvement (in groups) part 1 (d);   using [the wiki](https://github.com/apawlik/2015-02-11-idcc15/wiki)   
**15:00 - 15:30** Break  
**15:30 - 16:30** Collaborative lesson development and improvement (in groups) part 2;  using [the wiki](https://github.com/apawlik/2015-02-11-idcc15/wiki)   
**16:30 - 17:00** Reporting back and conclusions


(a)This part of the workshop will be taught as a Data Carpentry module. It's a "taster session".  

(b)The participants will be split into small groups of 4-5 and discuss the their experiences with regards to the lesson which they just participated in. The following questions should help guide the discussion:    

1. How did this style of lesson feel?   
2. What was good?   
3. What was missing?   
4. What would I improve?  
5. How? Would that be beneficial for what I do at work? if so how?)  
  
The participants (in groups) will be asked to come up with "3 improvements we would like to make to the lesson" (these can be anything - sequence, fixing typos, adding more explanation etc.)
  
(c)This discussion may alter the improvements the groups propose.

(d)The "collaborative lesson development/improvement" will be done via GitHub website interface. Leveraging GitHub infrastructure we will show the participants how even without knowing Git and GitHub it is possible to improve training material built by a community.


###How to work - some technical notes

We will be using R and RStudio. The setup instructions:

**WINDOWS**
Install R by downloading and running this .exe file fromCRAN. Also, please install the RStudio IDE.

**MAC OS**
Install R by downloading and running this .pkg file fromCRAN. Also, please install the RStudio IDE.

**LINUX**
You can download the binary files for your distribution fromCRAN. Or you can use your package manager, e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run apt-get install r-base oryum install R. Also, please install the RStudio IDE.

For the group work we will be using [the wiki](https://github.com/apawlik/2015-02-11-idcc15/wiki). You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to access it.
